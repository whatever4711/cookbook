    \newline
       \step Sieve dry ingredients into bowl. Add egg and syrup to mixture. Slowly add milk and beat well to create a batter which will pour from a spoon but must not be too thin. Don't leave standing too long before use.
       \step Heat a heavy frying pan and grease it with lard or white flora. Pour batter on, 1 table spoon at a time (= 1 pancake). Make several at a time but not too close together. When bubbles appear on the surface and just start to burst, turn pancakes over with a palette knife. Cook about 1 minute longer until golden brown.
